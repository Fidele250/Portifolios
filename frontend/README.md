#  Portfolio - Frontend

This is a modern **personal portfolio** showcasing profile, skills, and projects.  
The project uses **Django** as the backend and **React (with optional TypeScript)** as the frontend.  
The goal is to create a **clean, responsive, and interactive portfolio** for professional presentation.

## Features

- Clean and responsive **landing page**
- About Me section
- Projects section with dynamic content
- Contact form
- Integration with backend API (Django)
- Styled with CSS / Tailwind / your choice
- Mobile-friendly and fast-loading

## **Responsibilities** 

 **Follow this as a checklist for your work.**
**All tasks below are mandatory. Check them off as you implement:**

- [ ] Build a responsive navigation bar
- [ ] Create hero/home section with introduction and profile image
- [ ] Dynamically display projects and skills using data from Django API
- [ ] Implement contact form integrated with backend
- [ ] Add CV download button
- [ ] Ensure pages are mobile-friendly and accessible
- [ ] Implement animations / transitions for better UX
- [ ] Maintain reusable and modular React components
- [ ] Follow clean coding standards and commit frequently
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully




> **Note:**  
> You can request any additional API endpoints you need to implement features fully. And I will provide backend support or create the endpoints required for dynamic functionality.

## Best Practices & Approaches 

- Use component-based architecture for all sections
- Keep CSS modular or use Tailwind utility classes
- Document components where necessary
- Use environment variables for API URLs
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Review code for quality, performance, and responsiveness before pushing
- Collaborate using Git branches and pull requests
